# magicmouse

This is a mirror repository for Apple Magic Mouse 1 (removable batteries) and 2 (embedded battery) drivers. Use your magic mouse on any bluetooth enabled Windows machine. Realiable alternative to magic utilities, fix scroll not working.

### Whats the purpose

These packages are not readily available to end users and sometimes you'll not be able to find anywhere without downloading bootcamp from MacOS. These packages fix issues such as not being able to scroll or not detecting the device properly. Usually changes are ready and functional right after install but you may need to restart in some circumstances.
